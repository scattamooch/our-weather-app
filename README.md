# Our Weather App

## Design Goals

## 3 Event Listeners
- "click" event: navbar at the bottom with city names
    - pulls selected city to main div?

- "keydown" event: toggle light/dark mode on keypress
    - not sure if possible? we'll find out

- "mouseover" event: mouseover main image for generic weather warning and image invocation

## Single Page Requirement
- entire app must run on a single page
- no redirects or reloads

## Array Iteration
- navbar at the bottom will have example cities with selected shorthand weather info
    - info will be pruned from API via array iteration
